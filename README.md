# agri_zone_segmentations
This project applies unsupervised machine learning to solve a real-world agricultural problem: farmland is often treated uniformly despite having different climate behaviors across zones.  Using K-Means clustering, the project segments agricultural areas into meaningful climate zones based on temperature and rainfall.
